# Evidence Handling and Audit Readiness

Incident response decisions must be defensible beyond the technical response phase.

Proper evidence handling supports:
- Internal investigations
- Regulatory inquiries
- Legal proceedings
- Post-incident reviews

Governance considerations include:
- Preserving logs, alerts, and forensic artifacts
- Maintaining chain of custody
- Documenting decisions, timelines, and rationale

Well-documented evidence handling protects both the organization and the individuals involved in incident response.
