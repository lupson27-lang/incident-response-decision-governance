# Incident Response Decision Governance

This repository explores how organizations govern and make incident response (IR) decisions under real-world operational, legal, and business constraints.

Rather than focusing on technical response steps or tooling, this project examines:
- Decision authority and escalation models
- Trade-offs between containment, availability, and business impact
- Documentation and evidence handling
- Governance expectations during and after incidents

The goal is to demonstrate how effective incident response depends as much on judgment, structure, and accountability as on detection and response capabilities.
