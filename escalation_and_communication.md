# Escalation and Communication

Effective escalation and communication are critical during incident response.

Clear escalation paths ensure that incidents reach the appropriate technical, business, and executive stakeholders at the right time.

Key governance considerations include:
- When incidents must be escalated to executive leadership
- When legal, compliance, or privacy teams must be engaged
- Criteria for external notifications to regulators, customers, or partners

Poor communication and unclear escalation often amplify the impact of incidents more than the technical issues themselves.
