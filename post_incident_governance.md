# Post-Incident Governance

Effective incident response does not end with containment and recovery.

Post-incident governance ensures that incidents lead to measurable improvement rather than repeated failures.

Key governance activities include:
- Root cause and contributing factor analysis
- Review of detection, response, and decision effectiveness
- Identification of control gaps and risk treatment options
- Executive and audit reporting

Outcomes may include remediation, control enhancement, or formal risk acceptance. Strong organizations treat incidents as learning opportunities and integrate lessons into future security strategy.
