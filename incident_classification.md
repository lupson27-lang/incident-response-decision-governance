# Incident Classification

Incident classification establishes when a security event becomes an incident and how serious it is.

Organizations typically classify incidents based on:
- Impact to confidentiality, integrity, or availability
- Regulatory or legal exposure
- Operational disruption
- Safety or customer impact

Clear classification criteria reduce hesitation, inconsistency, and delayed escalation during response activities.
