# Containment vs Business Impact

Containment actions are intended to limit damage during an incident, but they often carry operational consequences.

Examples include:
- Isolating systems from the network
- Shutting down services or production lines
- Disabling user or service accounts

Organizations must balance:
- Speed of containment
- Business continuity and availability
- Safety, regulatory, and contractual obligations

Risk-based decision-making helps ensure containment actions are proportional, justified, and aligned with organizational priorities.
