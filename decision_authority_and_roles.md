# Decision Authority and Roles

Effective incident response depends on clearly defined decision authority.

Without predefined roles, organizations risk delays, conflicting actions, and unmanaged business impact.

Typical decision roles include:
- SOC or Detection Teams — Validate alerts and identify incidents
- Incident Commander — Coordinates response actions and priorities
- Business Leadership — Authorizes actions with operational impact
- Legal and Compliance — Advises on regulatory, contractual, and disclosure obligations

Clear authority models ensure decisions are timely, consistent, and defensible.
